### Hi there! Welcome to my Github Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Hoa and I am interested in all things data and machine learning systems. As a thirdâ€‘year Data Science student at the Ho Chi Minh University of Banking, I am seeking a Data Science/Data Analyst Intern position to apply my analytical skills and passion for extracting valuable insights from data. I like to read, hike, and explore different music genres over a cup of tea (In no particular order).

Check out my [Portfolio](https://nguyennhathoa6255.wixsite.com/hoasportfolio) for all of my projects, skills, and achievements.
